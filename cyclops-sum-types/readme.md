# Cyclops Sum Types

cyclops-sum-types defines Either implementations from Either through Either4 (to be extended).

All Either implementations have the following features


1. Right biased for ease of use
1. Rich API
1. Totally lazy
1. Tail recursive map / flatMap methods

Either extends cyclops-react Xor, providing a lazy and tail call optimized alternative.
